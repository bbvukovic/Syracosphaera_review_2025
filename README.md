# Manuscript Abstract
Coccolithophores are calcifying microalgae that play a vital role in marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. This manuscript reviews existing knowledge of their most diverse family, Syracosphaeraceae, and synthesizes data from the comprehensive CASCADE dataset, which includes global coccolithophore surveys, along with an additional dataset from the Atlantic. It focuses on the distribution, life cycles, and ecological preferences of key species within the genus *Syracosphaera*. By analyzing environmental factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, light, and water stratification through a literature review of the source manuscripts included in the CASCADE database, the study examines how these conditions shape species distributions and life stages. Seasonal variations in abundance highlight the genus’s ability to exploit diverse ecological niches, with species like *Syracosphaera molischii* and *Syracosphaera pulchra* exhibiting remarkable adaptability. This review emphasizes the ecological significance of *Syracosphaera* species in nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical waters, their resilience in polar regions, and their critical role in the marine carbon cycle. It also provides a foundation for future research into their adaptability to climate change.
