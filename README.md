# Vuković & Godrijan "Coccolithophore Diversity in Oceans: Insights from Syracosphaeraceae Family" (2025) BMC Ocean Microbiology - accompanying data

This repository contains all the figures (both from main text and supplementary materials), and the full R script used for data processing and creating visualizations for the paper:
**Vuković BB, Godrijan J. Coccolithophore Diversity in Oceans: Insights from Syracosphaeraceae Family (2025) BMC Ocean Microbiology**.

Additionally, this repository contains a dataset (Dukic2025.xlsx) with abundances and associated geographic coordinates of species from the *Syracosphaera* genus, extracted from data collected during the 2018 Atlantic CoccoMix cruise (DOI: [10.1126/sciadv.adf6973](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf6973)), which is analysed in this paper alongside the [CASCADE dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/13919889)
